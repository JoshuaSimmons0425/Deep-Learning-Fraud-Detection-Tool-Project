# About the Project

This project is a deep learning-based financial fraud detection system, designed to accurately identify fraudulent transactions in a structured dataset. The goal is to maximise recall while preserving a reasonable precision, ensuring that most fraudulent transactions are caught with minimal false positives.

Built with a focus on real-world applicability, the project demonstrates key techniques in preprocessing, model training, performance optimization, and explainability, all aligned with the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) framework.

# Project Goal

- Objective: Accurately detect fraudulent financial transactions using supervised machine learning.
- Key Metric: Prioritise high recall to minimize undetected fraud cases, while maintaining acceptable precision to avoid too many false alarms.
- Challenge: Handle high class imbalance (fraudulent vs. non-fraudulent cases) effectively through weight penalty and model tuning.

# Tools & Libraries Used

- Python (NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Scikit-learn for model training and evaluation
- PyTorch for deep learning (neural network modeling)
- Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualizing evaluation metrics

# Techniques & Features

Exploretory Data Analysis

- Class Occurances Visualization using a Histogram 
- Summary statistics to evaulate the distributions and proporties of each feature
- Boxplots & Histograms to examine distribution and detect outliers

Data Preparation and Prepocessing:

Feature construction using:
- Transactional balance changes (e.g., newBalanceOrigin - oldBalanceOrigin)
- Absolute and relative differences

Missing value detection and population using:
- Mode to populate a discrete value in a categorical feature
- Mean to populate a continous value in a numerical feature

Modelling:

- Neural network with weighted loss (to counter class imbalance)
- Threshold tuning to optimize recall/precision tradeoff

Evaluation: 

- Confusion matrix
- Precision-Recall tradeoff graph
- F1-score, precision and recall values
- Model comparison using performance metrics under various thresholds
