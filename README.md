# About the Project

This project is a deep learning-based financial fraud detection system, designed to accurately identify fraudulent transactions in a structured dataset. The goal is to maximise recall while preserving a reasonable precision, ensuring that most fraudulent transactions are caught with minimal false positives.

Built with a focus on real-world applicability, the project demonstrates key techniques in preprocessing, model training, performance optimization and evaluation; all aligned with the CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) framework.

The dataset I chose came from Kaggle. Here is the link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/code/kartik2khandelwal/predicting-fraudulent-transactions/input

# Project Goal

- Objective: Accurately detect fraudulent financial transactions using supervised machine learning with a neural network model.
- Key Metric: Prioritise high recall to minimise undetected fraud cases, while maintaining acceptable precision to avoid too many false alarms.
- Challenge: Handle high class imbalance (fraudulent vs. non-fraudulent cases) effectively through weight penalty and model tuning.

# Tools & Libraries Used

- Python (NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Scikit-learn for model training and evaluation
- PyTorch for deep learning (neural network modeling)
- Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualizing evaluation metrics
